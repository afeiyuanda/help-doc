### 工具

Tools are programs for processing data on the Platform. Tools can be run alone or as part of a workflow. They are graphically represented in the visual interface as nodes.

Tip: Many tools are maintained by the Seven Bridges bioinformatics team on the Platform as public apps. If you choose to use your own tools, you can import them using the SDK.

### 流程

Workflows are chains of interconnected tools. They are fully modifiable using the workflow editor and can be run as is or added to a project.

Tip: Many workflows are maintained by the Seven Bridges bioinformatics team on the Platform as public apps.

## R
### 任务

A task is a single execution of a tool or a workflow in a project.

Tip: To access your tasks, first log into your account. Then, click on the Projects tab. Select the appropriate project to access its Project Dashboard. On the top right corner, you will see a row of tabs. Click on the Tasks tab. Here you can find more information on each executed task as well as each draft task.

### 任务日志

Task logs are produced for every job in the task. They include .log files, std.err files, and std.out files. These are useful when troubleshooting failed tasks.

Tip: To access your task logs, first log into your account. Then, click on the Projects tab. Select the appropriate project to access its Project Dashboard. On the top right corner, you will see a row of tabs. Click on the Tasks tab. Here you can find more information on each executed task as well as each draft task.

### 任务状态

Task statistics are available for every task on the Platform, which can be useful when optimizing a task or debugging one that has failed.

## S
### 数据

Data is packaged as files and fed into workflows for analysis. Files are stored on the Platform in two repositories: Public Reference Files and Project Files.

See also: files, project, project files, public reference files

### 输入

Inputs are data that is supplied to a tool.

Tip: Typically, inputs are files. However, if you are installing your own tool on the Platform using the SDK, then any parameters or settings that are supplied to the tool are treated as inputs and are accepted by their own input ports, which you should specify in the tool editor.

## W
### 文件

Files are units of data fed into workflows for analysis. Files are stored on the Platform in two repositories: Public Reference Files and Project Files.

### 文件属性

File tags are used on the Seven Bridges Platform as a way to annotate files (both public reference files and the ones within your project) with relevant information about their type or purpose. This can help you differentiate them more easily and allow you to filter files based on their tags. To learn more about file tags see: Tag your files and Filter by tags.

## X
### 项目
Projects are the core building blocks of the Platform. Each project corresponds to a distinct scientific investigation, serving as a container for its data, analysis tools, results, and team of collaborators. However, multiple workflow executions can be carried out within a project.

## Y
### 应用

Apps are bioinformatics tools and workflows. The Platform hosts many pre-built apps that are ready to use. They are put on the Platform and maintained by the Seven Bridges bioinformatics team. These apps can be executed on the Platform as is.

Tip: Public apps are available on the Platform, but you can also bring your own tools and design your own workflows.
